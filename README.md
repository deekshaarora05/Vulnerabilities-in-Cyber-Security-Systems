# Vulnerabilities-in-Security-Systems

Explored the vulnerabilities in network and web security systems which can lead to information leakage, frauds and other serious damage to the users/organizations.
### NOTE: All the experiments are carried out on rootsh3ll labs platform and while performing the attacks the environment is not shared with any real-world network.
Worked on the following vulnerabilities:
<ul>
  <li> Tested for potential vulnerabilities in a computer network. </li>
  <li> Used NMAP- a free security scanner for discovering networks and security audit of these networks. </li>
  <li> Analyzed live wireless traffic and decrypted it without authenticating the router. </li>
  <li> Performed Wireless Penetration Testing. </li>
  <li> Explored Network Traces. </li>
  <li> Risk/Vulnerability Assessment on wired network (Exploited vulnerabilities of MySQL). </li>
  <li> Performed SQL Injection Attack. </li>
  <li> Performed a Cross-Site Request Forgery attack- widely exploited in web applications. </li>
  <li> Performed XSS attack. </li>
</ul>
